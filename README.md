# Login page (partial)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Implementation notes

- I have not cleaned up the login page to production state by far, due to time constraints.
  However, it should be understandable how I would progress to finish it. For that purpose I also diverted from the UI required.
- The code would need cleanup, the LoginForm is very long and in production I would split it into components
- In low resolution screens it would make sense to make the sign in button full width and put it below the forgot password
- Login action calls delay and randomly select success or failure (see /src/containers/LoginPage/saga.ts). Failure would just put error on password field,
  success is ignored.
- I did not provide aria https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/
- For production tests would be required
